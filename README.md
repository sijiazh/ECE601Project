# ECE601Project
This is an android peer to peer video chat app done as part of EC601 project by Deepak TS, Sijia and Qu. The main aim of this project is to establish a video call between 2 users. 
Software used : Android Studio 2.2


The final version of our program is called "RTCcombinedsuccessfully" which can be opened in Android Studio and run in the emulator. And the final sprint ppt is peertopeervideochat.ppt.
The final demo video is called finaldemo.mov.

Before opened in the emulator, the project's launch activity should be set as com.amazonaws.youruserpools.MainActivity. But it can run very well in real Android phone without setting launch activity.

We changed the layout of origin videochat software which has one remote view and one local view and now it becomes 4 windows for video view to get ready for enable dual camera.
