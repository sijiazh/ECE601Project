Sprint 2 outline:

Done:
	1.	research:  Only a few devices (Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, HTC One M8), the hardware capability to run both the cameras at the same time. 
	2.	Samples: Compared a few open source webrtc samples, and chose the one that we thought will best fit our needs.
	3.	#create the database for the application to store users information
	4.	#modify the “favorite” part of the sample
	5.	doing: add log in system in the project


Challenges:
	1.	enable both camera at the same time during a video chat
	2.	signup the app using an authenticated phone number
	3.	add “invite friend” by sending message


Expected:
	1.	combine database with signup system.
	2.	remove “favorite room” from the application
	3.	enable both cameras and modify the layout of video chat
